      <h3>Who I Am</h3>
      <p>I'm Abdalla Elkilany, a Computer Engineer and Full-Stack Developer with a Bachelor's degree from Helwan University Cairo. With over a year of professional experience in web development and 1+ year of freelance work, I specialize in building scalable, user-friendly applications using modern tech stacks like .NET Core, Angular, and SQL Server.</p>
      
      <p>My journey in tech began with a passion for solving real-world problems, which led me to develop projects like a smart surveillance system for criminal behavior detectionâ€”a full-stack solution combining deep learning and computer vision.</p>
      
      <p>Recently, I completed mandatory military service at the Egyptian Military Academy's IT department, where I honed skills in IT systems management, network administration, and disciplined teamwork. Now, I'm actively seeking opportunities as a Junior Software Engineer or Full-Stack Engineer, particularly in Riyadh, to contribute my technical expertise and collaborative mindset to innovative projects.</p>
