        <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Abdalla Elkilany, a Computer Engineer and Full-Stack Developer with a Bachelor’s degree from Helwan University Cairo. With over a year of professional experience in web development and 1+ year of freelance work, I specialize in building scalable, user-friendly applications using modern tech stacks like .NET Core, Angular, and SQL Server. My journey in tech began with a passion for solving real-world problems, which led me to develop projects like a smart surveillance system for criminal behavior detection—a full-stack solution combining deep learning and computer vision. Recently, I completed mandatory military service at the Egyptian Military Academy’s IT department, where I honed skills in IT systems management, network administration, and disciplined teamwork. Now, I’m actively seeking opportunities as a Junior Software Engineer or Full-Stack Engineer, particularly in Riyadh, to contribute my technical expertise and collaborative mindset to innovative projects.</p>

    <h2>My Approach & Philosophy</h2>
    <p>I thrive on writing clean, maintainable code and architecting solutions that bridge technical efficiency with user needs. My toolkit includes backend development with .NET Core/C#, frontend engineering with Angular, and robust database design with SQL Server. I’m deeply committed to continuous learning, whether exploring AI model evaluation, mastering event-driven microservices with Kafka, or contributing to open-source projects. Beyond code, I believe in the power of adaptability—a skill sharpened during my military service—and I actively engage with tech communities to stay ahead of industry trends. Let’s connect to discuss AI, full-stack development, or how we can collaborate to build impactful software!</p>
